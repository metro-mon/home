<h2><center>A Minecraft Server for Pokemon and Train Enthusiasts Alike</center></h2>
<h3><center>Welcome</center></h3>

<center>Welcome to Quag's, a Minecraft Server centered around the <b>Minecraft Transit Railway</b> (MTR) mod.</center>

<center><h3>About the Server</h3></center>
<center><p>We are the first <b>Mohist 1.16.5</b> server that uses the MTR Mod. Mohist combines the <i>Forge</i> modloader as well as <i>Bukkit, Spigot and Paper</i> plugins. We are currently on soft opening as we build more and more of the map.</p>
<h3>About the Server Map</h3>

Our server is a Minecraft recreation of a Pokemon Region map with some changes and new regions. We use the MTR mod to construct and operate train stations. Furthermore, we use more plugins and mods such as <b>Create, Moving Elevators and PowerRanks.</b>
